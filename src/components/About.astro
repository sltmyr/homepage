const description = `
I am an experienced, full-stack software engineer with a track record of delivering high-quality software and a particular interest in data-heavy projects.
Working with clients from different countries, in teams of different sizes, and with different technologies made me a well rounded engineer with a focus on reducing complexity.
In my experience, keeping things simple is the only way to deliver solid, maintainable software while keeping the development speed high and delivering value.
I feel at home in the AWS cloud, the React ecosystem and projects with large amounts of data.`;
